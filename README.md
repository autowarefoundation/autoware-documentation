# autoware-documentation

- This repository contains the [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) source files for the [Autoware documentation hosted on GitHub Pages](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/).
- Since Autoware is made up of [multiple repositories](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/), a central documentation repository is important to make information accessible from a single place.
- For more information about Autoware and its related repositories, refer to the [Autoware Foundation's organization profile](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md).
