# Enable `multicast` on `lo`

## Manually (temporary solution)

You may just call the following command to enable multicast on the loopback interface.

```bash
sudo ip link set lo multicast on
```

!!! warning

    This will be reverted once the computer restarts. To make it permanent, follow the steps below.

!!! note

    Here, `lo` is the loopback interface.

    You can check the interfaces with `ip link show`.

    You may change `lo` with the interface you want to enable multicast on.

## On startup with a service (permanent solution)

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/multicast-lo.service
```

Paste the following into the file:

```service
[Unit]
Description=Enable Multicast on Loopback

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/ip link set lo multicast on

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Press following in order to save with nano:

1. `Ctrl+X`
2. `Y`
3. `Enter`

```bash
# Make it recognized
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Make it run on startup
sudo systemctl enable multicast-lo.service

# Start it now
sudo systemctl start multicast-lo.service
```
