# Installation of Autoware

There are two ways to set up Autoware. Choose one according to your preference.

## 1. Docker installation

Docker can ensure that all developers in a project have a common, consistent development environment.
It is recommended for beginners, light users, people who do not use Ubuntu.

See [here](docker-installation.md) for the detailed steps.  
Refer to [autowarefoundation/autoware/docker/README.md](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/blob/main/docker/README.md) as well.

## 2. Source installation

Source installation is for the cases where more granular control of the installation environment is needed.
It is recommended for skilled users or people who want to customize the environment.  
Note that some problems may occur depending on your local environment.

See [here](source-installation.md) for the detailed steps.  
Refer to the [autowarefoundation/autoware/README.md](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/blob/main/README.md) as well.
