# Source installation

## Prerequisites

- [Ubuntu 20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [Registering SSH keys to GitHub](https://github.com/settings/keys) is preferable.

```bash
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install git
```

## How to set up a development environment

1. Clone `autowarefoundation/autoware` and move to the directory.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.git
   cd autoware
   ```

2. Install the dependencies.

   We use [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to simplify the steps.
   Please see the Ansible playbooks and roles if you want to know exactly what packages are installed.

   > Note: Before installing NVIDIA libraries, confirm and agree with the licenses.

   - [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/eula/index.html)
   - [cuDNN](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/sla/index.html)
   - [TensorRT](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/sla/index.html)

   ```bash
   ./setup-dev-env.sh
   ```

!!!warning

    Be very careful with this method. Make sure you read and confirmed all the steps in the Ansible configuration before using it.

If you want to manually install the dependencies:

- See the roles in [universe.yaml](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/blob/main/ansible/playbooks/universe.yaml).
- Read the READMEs of each role under the [ansible/roles](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/tree/main/ansible/roles) directory.
- Install the listed dependencies following the linked resources.

## How to set up a workspace

1. Create the `src` directory and clone repositories into it.

   Autoware uses [vcstool](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool) to construct workspaces.

   ```bash
   cd autoware
   mkdir src
   vcs import src < autoware.repos
   ```

2. Install dependent ROS packages.

   Autoware requires some ROS 2 packages in addition to the core components.
   The tool `rosdep` allows an automatic search and installation of such dependencies.

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO
   ```

3. Build the workspace.

   Autoware uses [colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/index.html) to build workspaces.
   Refer to the documentation for more advanced options.

   ```bash
   colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   ```

## How to update a workspace

1. Update the `.repos` file.

   ```bash
   cd autoware
   git pull
   ```

2. Update the repositories.

   ```bash
   vcs import src < autoware.repos
   vcs pull
   ```

   For Git users:

   - `vcs import` is similar to `git checkout`.
     - Note that it doesn't pull from the remote.
   - `vcs pull` is similar to `git pull`.
     - Note that it doesn't switch branches.

   Refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool) for more information.

3. Install dependent ROS packages.

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO
   ```

4. Build the workspace.

   ```bash
   colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   ```
