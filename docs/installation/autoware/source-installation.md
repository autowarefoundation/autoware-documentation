# Source installation

## Prerequisites

- OS

  - [Ubuntu 22.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/)

- ROS

  - ROS 2 Humble

  For ROS 2 system dependencies, refer to [REP-2000](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html).

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [Registering SSH keys to GitHub](https://github.com/settings/keys) is preferable.

```bash
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install git
```

> Note: If you wish to use ROS 2 Galactic on Ubuntu 20.04, refer to installation instruction from [galactic](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/galactic/installation/autoware/source-installation/) branch, but be aware that Galactic version of Autoware might not have the latest features.

## How to set up a development environment

1. Clone `autowarefoundation/autoware` and move to the directory.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.git
   cd autoware
   ```

2. If you are installing Autoware for the first time, you can automatically install the dependencies by using the provided Ansible script.

   ```bash
   ./setup-dev-env.sh
   ```

   If you encounter any build issues, please consult the [Troubleshooting](../../support/troubleshooting/index.md#build-issues) section for assistance.

## How to set up a workspace

!!! info "[Using Autoware Build GUI](#using-autoware-build-gui)"

    If you prefer a graphical user interface (GUI) over the command line for launching and managing your simulations, refer to the `Using Autoware Build GUI` section at the end of this document for a step-by-step guide.

1. Create the `src` directory and clone repositories into it.

   Autoware uses [vcstool](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool) to construct workspaces.

   ```bash
   cd autoware
   mkdir src
   vcs import src < autoware.repos
   ```

2. Install dependent ROS packages.

   Autoware requires some ROS 2 packages in addition to the core components.
   The tool `rosdep` allows an automatic search and installation of such dependencies.
   You might need to run `rosdep update` before `rosdep install`.

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   rosdep install -y --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO
   ```

3. Build the workspace.

   Autoware uses [colcon](https://github.com/colcon) to build workspaces.
   For more advanced options, refer to the [documentation](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/).

   ```bash
   colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   ```

   If there is any build issue, refer to [Troubleshooting](../../support/troubleshooting/index.md#build-issues).

## How to update a workspace

1. Update the `.repos` file.

   ```bash
   cd autoware
   git pull <remote> <your branch>
   ```

   `<remote>` is usually `git@github.com:autowarefoundation/autoware.git`

2. Update the repositories.

   ```bash
   vcs import src < autoware.repos
   vcs pull src
   ```

   For Git users:

   - `vcs import` is similar to `git checkout`.
     - Note that it doesn't pull from the remote.
   - `vcs pull` is similar to `git pull`.
     - Note that it doesn't switch branches.

   For more information, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool).

3. Install dependent ROS packages.

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   rosdep install -y --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO
   ```

4. Build the workspace.

   ```bash
   colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   ```

## Using Autoware Build GUI

In addition to the traditional command-line methods of building Autoware packages, developers and users can leverage the Autoware Build GUI for a more streamlined and user-friendly experience. This GUI application simplifies the process of building and managing Autoware packages.

### Integration with Autoware source installation

When using the Autoware Build GUI in conjunction with the traditional source installation process:

- **Initial Setup**: Follow the standard Autoware source installation guide to set up your environment and workspace.
- **Using the GUI**: Once the initial setup is complete, you can use the Autoware Build GUI to manage subsequent builds and package updates.

This integration offers a more accessible approach to building and managing Autoware packages, catering to both new users and experienced developers.

### Getting started with Autoware Build GUI

1. **Installation:** Ensure you have installed the Autoware Build GUI. [Installation instructions](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware-build-gui#installation).
2. **Launching the App**: Once installed, launch the Autoware Build GUI.
   ![Build_GUI_Main](images/build-gui/build_gui_main.png)
3. **Setting Up**: Set the path to your Autoware folder within the GUI.
   ![Build_GUI_Setup](images/build-gui/build_gui_setup.png)
4. **Building Packages**: Select the Autoware packages you wish to build and manage the build process through the GUI.
   ![Build_GUI_Build](images/build-gui/build_gui_build.png)

   4.1. **Build Configuration**: Choose from a list of default build configurations, or select the packages you wish to build manually.
   ![Build_GUI_Build_Configuration](images/build-gui/build_gui_build_configuration.png)

   4.2. **Build Options**: Choose which build type you wish to use, with ability to specify additional build options.
   ![Build_GUI_Build_Options](images/build-gui/build_gui_build_options.png)

5. **Save and Load**: Save your build configurations for future use, or load a previously saved configuration if you don't wish to build all packages or use one of the default configurations provided.
   ![Build_GUI_Save](images/build-gui/build_gui_save.png)
6. **Updating Workspace**: Update your Autoware workspace's packages to the latest version using the GUI or adding Calibration tools to the workspace.
