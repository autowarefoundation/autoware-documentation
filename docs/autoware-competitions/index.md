Any researchers, students, individuals or organizations are welcome to participate and submit their solution to any of the challenges we propose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The qualifiers use the [digital twin autonomous driving simulator AWSIM](https://tier4.github.io/AWSIM/) to complete specific tasks within a virtual environment. Teams that make it to the finals have the opportunity to run their software on actual vehicles in a test course in Japan. |

Participants will develop autonomous driving software based on [Autoware.Universe](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe), and integrate it into a racing car that runs in the End to End simulation space (AWSIM). The goal is simple, win the race while driving safely!                                                                                                                                        |
