   ```

### Note

- Sample map and rosbag: Copyright 2020 TIER IV, Inc.
- Due to privacy concerns, the rosbag does not contain image data, which will cause:
  - Traffic light recognition functionality cannot be tested with this sample rosbag.
  - Object detection accuracy is decreased.

## How to run a rosbag replay simulation

1. Launch Autoware.

   ```sh
   source ~/autoware/install/setup.bash
   ros2 launch autoware_launch logging_simulator.launch.xml map_path:=$HOME/Downloads/sample-map-rosbag vehicle_model:=sample_vehicle sensor_model:=sample_sensor_kit
   ```

   Note that you cannot use `~` instead of `$HOME` here.

2. Play the sample rosbag file.

   ```sh
   source ~/autoware/install/setup.bash
   ros2 bag play ~/Downloads/sample-rosbag/sample.db3 -r 0.2
   ```

3. To focus the view on the ego vehicle, change the `Target Frame` in the RViz Views panel from `viewer` to `base_link`.

4. To switch the view to `Third Person Follower` etc, change the `Type` in the RViz Views panel.
