# AWSIM simulator

AWSIM is a simulator for Autoware development and testing, initially developed by TIER IV and still actively maintained.

AWSIM Labs is a fork of AWSIM, developed under the Autoware Foundation, providing additional features and lighter resource usage.

## AWSIM Labs

[AWSIM Labs](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/AWSIM-Labs) supports Unity LTS 2022.3.21f1 and uses the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), optimized for lighter resource usage. It introduces several enhancements such as the ability to reset vehicle positions at runtime, support for multiple scenes and vehicle setups on runtime, and multi-lidars enabled by default.

## AWSIM

[AWSIM](https://github.com/tier4/AWSIM) runs on Unity 2021.1.7f1 using the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), which requires more system resources.
