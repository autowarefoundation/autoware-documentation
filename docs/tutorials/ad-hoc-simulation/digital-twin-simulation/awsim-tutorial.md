# AWSIM simulator

!!! note

    Current instruction of AWSIM is based on the ROS2 Galactic, while Autoware Universe has already switched to the ROS2 Humble. Following the official instruction will still work, however it is currently not possible to run AWSIM sample binary with the main branch of Autoware. TierIV is working on the transition of AWSIM to ROS2 Humble.

AWSIM is a simulator for Autoware development and testing. To get started, please follow the official [instruction](https://tier4.github.io/AWSIM/GettingStarted/QuickStartDemo/) provided by TIER IV.
