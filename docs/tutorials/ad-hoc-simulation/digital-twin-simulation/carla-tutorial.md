# CARLA simulator

[CARLA](https://carla.org) is a famous open-source simulator for the autonomous driving research.
Now there is no official support to Autoware.universe, but some projects from communities support it.
The document is to list these projects for anyone who wants to run Autoware with Carla.
You can report issues to each project if there is any problem.

The project is mainly for controlling multiple vehicles in Carla.
