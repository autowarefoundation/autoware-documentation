# Planning simulation

## Preparation

1. Download and unpack a sample map.

   - Click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1499_nsbUbIeturZaDj7jhUownh5fvXHd/view?usp=sharing) to download.
   - Unpack it by running the following command.

   ```bash
   unzip -d ~/Downloads/ ~/Downloads/sample-map-planning.zip
   ```

## How to run a planning simulation

1. Launch Autoware.

   ```sh
   source ~/autoware/install/setup.bash
   ros2 launch autoware_launch planning_simulator.launch.xml map_path:=$HOME/Downloads/sample-map-planning vehicle_model:=sample_vehicle sensor_model:=sample_sensor_kit
   ```

   Note that you cannot use `~` instead of `$HOME` here.

2. Set an initial pose for the ego vehicle.

   - a) Click the `2D Pose estimate` button in the toolbar, or hit the `P` key
   - b) In the 3D View pane, click and hold the left-mouse button, and then drag to set the direction for the initial pose.

3. Set a goal pose for the ego vehicle.

   - a) Click the `2D Nav Goal` button in the toolbar, or hit the `G` key
   - b) In the 3D View pane, click and hold the left-mouse button, and then drag to set the direction for the goal pose.

4. To place a dummy object such as a pedestrian, click the `2D Dummy Pedestrian` button in the toolbar.

5. Engage the ego vehicle.

   ```bash
   ros2 topic pub /autoware/engage autoware_auto_vehicle_msgs/msg/Engage "engage: true" -1
   ```

6. To delete objects, click the `Delete All Objects` button in the toolbar.

7. After that, the vehicle will restart driving and reach the goal.

## How to simulate parking maneuvers

1. Set an initial pose and a goal pose, and engage the ego vehicle.

   ![after-set-goal-pose](images/planning/parking/after-set-goal-pose.png)

2. When the vehicle approaches the goal, it will change to the parking mode.

3. After that, the vehicle will start driving backwards and park at the destination parking spot.
