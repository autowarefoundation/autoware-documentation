# Autoware Multi-Year Roadmap

We need to set the key objectives and multi-year goals we wish to achieve as AWF in alignment with our vision, mission and core values. Based on these key objectives and goals, we can then create an execution plan which scopes out how we will achieve our desired goals.

We have currently defined 8 Key Objectives covering three themes: Technology, Membership & Open Source Community, and Brand. For each Key Objective, we have defined goals over a three year period (Y1 - Y3).
