# Creating a vector map

## Overview

In this section, we will explain how to create Lanelet2 maps with TIER IV's [vector map builder tool](https://tools.tier4.jp/feature/vector_map_builder_ll2/).

If you want to look at another method,
[MapToolbox](https://github.com/autocore-ai/MapToolbox) is a plugin for [Unity](https://unity.com/) specifically designed to create Lanelet2 maps for Autoware.
We didn't recommend [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) since it needs modifications for Autoware usage.
So, this process can be tedious and time-consuming.

## Vector Map Builder

You need a TIER IV account for using vector map builder tool.
So, if you have not before, please [create a TIER IV account](https://account.tier4.jp/registration?return_to=/oidc/login?login_challenge=81c846efae994bf8a79dac0aab6b8875)

For more information about this tool, please check the [official guide](https://docs.web.auto/en/user-manuals/vector-map-builder/introduction).

You can follow these pages for creating a Lanelet2 map and its regulatory elements.
