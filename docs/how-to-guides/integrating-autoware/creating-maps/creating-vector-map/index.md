# Creating a vector map

## Overview

In this section, we will explain how to create Lanelet2 maps with TIER IV's [Vector Map Builder tool](https://tools.tier4.jp/feature/vector_map_builder_ll2/).

There are alternative tools such as
Unity-based app [MapToolbox](https://github.com/autocore-ai/MapToolbox) and
Java-based app [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) that you may use for creating a Lanelet2 map.
We will be using TIER IV's Vector Map Builder in the tutorial
since it works on a browser without installation of extra dependency applications.

## Vector Map Builder
