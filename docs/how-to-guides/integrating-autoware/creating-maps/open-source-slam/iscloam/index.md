# ISCLOAM

## What is ISCLOAM?

- ISCLOAM presents a robust loop closure detection approach by integrating both geometry and intensity information.

## Repository Information

### Original Repository link

[https://github.com/wh200720041/iscloam](https://github.com/wh200720041/iscloam)

### Required Sensors

- LIDAR [Velodyne]

### ROS Compatibility

- ROS 1

### Dependencies

- Ubuntu 64-bit 18.04
- ROS Melodic [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)
- Ceres Solver [Ceres Installation](http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html)
- PCL [PCL Installation](https://pointclouds.org/downloads/)
- Gtsam [GTSAM Installation](https://gtsam.org/get_started/)
- OpenCV [OPENCV Installation](https://opencv.org/releases/)
- Trajectory visualization

For visualization purpose, this package uses hector trajectory sever, you may install the package by

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-hector-trajectory-server
```

## Build and Run

### 1. Clone repository

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/wh200720041/iscloam.git
cd ..
catkin_make -j1
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

### 2. Set Parameter

Change the bag location and sensor parameters on launch files.

### 3. Launch

```bash
roslaunch iscloam iscloam.launch
```

if you would like to generate the map of environment at the same time, you can run

```bash
roslaunch iscloam iscloam_mapping.launch
```

Note that the global map can be very large, so it may takes a while to perform global optimization, some lag is expected between trajectory and map since they are running in separate thread. More CPU usage will happen when loop closure is identified.
