# Rosbag2 Anonymizer

## Overview

Autoware provides a tool ([autoware_rosbag2_anonymizer](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_rosbag2_anonymizer)) to anonymize ROS 2 bag files.
This tool is useful when you want to share your data with Autoware community but want to keep the privacy of the data.

With this tool you can blur any object (faces, license plates, etc.) in your bag files, and you can get a new bag file
with the blurred images.

git clone https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_rosbag2_anonymizer.git
cd autoware_rosbag2_anonymizer
```

```

### Install ROS 2 mcap dependencies if you will use mcap files

!!! warning

    Be sure you have installed the ROS 2 on your system.

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-rosbag2-storage-mcap
```

### Install `autoware_rosbag2_anonymizer` tool

Before installing the tool, you should update the pip package manager.

```bash
python3 -m pip install pip -U
```

Then, you can install the tool with the following command.

```bash
python3 -m pip install .
```

## Configuration

Define prompts in the `validation.json` file. The tool will use these prompts to detect objects. You can add your prompts
as dictionaries under the prompts key. Each dictionary should have two keys:

- `prompt`: The prompt that will be used to detect the object. This prompt will be blurred in the anonymization process.
- `should_inside`: This is a list of prompts that object should be inside. If the object is not inside the prompts, the
  tool will not blur the object.

```json
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "prompt": "license plate",
      "should_inside": ["car", "bus", "..."]
    },
    {
      "prompt": "human face",
      "should_inside": ["person", "human body", "..."]
    }
  ]
}
```

You should set your configuration in the configuration files under config folder according to the usage. Following
instructions will guide you to set each configuration file.

```yaml
rosbag:
  input_bags_folder: "/path/to/input_bag_folder" # Path to the input folder which contains ROS 2 bag files

```

- `config/yolo_train.yaml`

```yaml
dataset:
  input_dataset_yaml: "path/to/data.yaml" # Path to the config file of the dataset, which is created in the previous step

yolo:
  epochs: 100 # Number of epochs for the YOLOv8 model (int)
  model: "yolov8x.pt" # Select the base model for YOLOv8 ('yolov8x.pt' 'yolov8l.pt', 'yolov8m.pt', 'yolov8n.pt')
```

- `config/yolo_anonymize.yaml`

```yaml
rosbag:
  input_bag_path: "/path/to/input_bag/bag.mcap" # Path to the input ROS 2 bag file with 'mcap' or 'sqlite3' extension
  output_bag_path: "/path/to/output_bag_file" # Path to the output ROS 2 bag folder
  output_save_compressed_image: True # Save images as compressed images (True or False)
  output_storage_id: "sqlite3" # Storage id for the output bag file (`sqlite3` or `mcap`)

yolo:
  model: "path/to/yolo/model" # Path to the trained YOLOv8 model file (`.pt` extension) (you can download the pre-trained model from releases)
  config_path: "path/to/input/data.yaml" # Path to the config file of the dataset, which is created in the previous step
  confidence: 0.15 # Confidence threshold for the YOLOv8 model (float)

```

## Usage

The tool provides two options to anonymize images in ROS 2 bag files.

!!! warning

    If your ROS 2 bag file includes custom message types from Autoware or any other packages, you should source the
    their workspaces before running the tool.

    You can source Autoware workspace with the following command.
    ```bash
    source /path/to/your/workspace/install/setup.bash
    ```

### Option 1: Anonymize with Unified Model

You should provide a single rosbag and tool anonymize images in rosbag with a unified model. The model is a combination
of GroundingDINO, OpenCLIP, YOLOv8 and SegmentAnything. If you don't want to use pre-trained YOLOv8 model, you can
follow the instructions in the second option to train your own YOLOv8 model.

You should set your configuration in config/anonymize_with_unified_model.yaml file.

```bash
python3 main.py config/anonymize_with_unified_model.yaml --anonymize_with_unified_model
```

### Option 2: Anonymize Using the YOLOv8 Model Trained on a Dataset Created with the Unified Model

#### Step 1: Create a Dataset

Create an initial dataset with the unified model. You can provide multiple ROS 2 bag files to create a dataset. After
running the following command, the tool will create a dataset in YOLO format.

You should set your configuration in config/yolo_create_dataset.yaml file.

```bash
python3 main.py config/yolo_create_dataset.yaml --yolo_create_dataset
```

#### Step 2: Manually Label the Missing Labels

The dataset which is created in the first step has some missing labels. You should label the missing labels manually.
You can use the following example tools to label the missing labels:

- [label-studio](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio)
- [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) (You can use the free version)

#### Step 3: Split the Dataset

Split the dataset into training and validation sets. Give the path to the dataset folder which is created in the first
step.

```bash
autoware-rosbag2-anonymizer-split-dataset /path/to/dataset/folder
```

#### Step 4: Train the YOLOv8 Model

Train the YOLOv8 model with the dataset which is created in the first step.

You should set your configuration in config/yolo_train.yaml file.

```bash
python3 main.py config/yolo_train.yaml --yolo_train
```

#### Step 5: Anonymize Images in ROS 2 Bag Files

Anonymize images in ROS 2 bag files with the trained YOLOv8 model. If you want to anonymize your ROS 2 bag file with only
YOLOv8 model, you should use following command. But we recommend to use the unified model for better results. You can
follow the Option 1 for the unified model with the YOLOv8 model trained by you.

You should set your configuration in config/yolo_anonymize.yaml file.

```bash
python3 main.py config/yolo_anonymize.yaml --yolo_anonymize
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Error 1**: `torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory`

```bash
torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1024.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 10.87 GiB of which 1010.88 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 8.66 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 8.21 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 266.44 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management  (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables)
```

This error occurs when the GPU memory is not enough to run the model. You can add the following environment variable to
avoid this error.

```bash
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True
```

## Share Your Anonymized Data

After anonymizing your data, you can share your anonymized data with the Autoware community. If you want to share your
data with the Autoware community, you should create an issue and pull request to
the [Autoware Documentation repository](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware-documentation).
