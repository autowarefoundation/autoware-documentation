# Planning component design

## Purpose

The role of the Planning Component in autonomous driving systems is to generate a target trajectory (path and speed) for autonomous vehicles that is safe and following traffic rules, in order to fulfill a given mission.

This document summarizes the requirements and design of planning in Autoware. This will enable developers to understand how the Planning Component is designed and how to extend its capabilities.

The first half of the document discusses high-level requirements and design, while the latter half covers actual implementations and provided functionalities.

## Goals and non-goals

Our goal is not the development of just an autonomous driving system, but the provision of an autonomous driving "platform." On this platform, anyone can extend the functionalities of autonomous driving based on their needs.

In Autoware, we employ the concept of a [microautonomy architecture](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/autoware-concepts). Microautonomy is a design concept for autonomous driving systems focused on high extensibility, based on appropriate functional modularity and clear interface definitions.

With this in mind, the design policy for the Planning component is not to solve all the complex use cases of autonomous driving (as that is a very challenging problem), but **to provide a Planning development platform that can be customized according to user needs and easily extended by anyone**. We believe that as our platform gains extensibility to various needs, many complex use cases will ultimately be resolved.

To clarify this policy, Goals and Non-Goals are listed below.

**Goals:**

- **To have the minimum basic functions necessary for autonomous driving**
  - Prior to extension of functionalities, the Planning Component must offer essential functionalities for autonomous driving. This includes basic planning like moving forward and backward, stopping, and turning, as well as lane changes and obstacle avoidance in relatively safe and simple situations.
- **Provided functionalities are modularized, and anyone can extend them**
  - This means being able to respond to the expected ODD with extended functionalities. If anyone can extend functionalities like a plugin, systems tailored to various needs can be provided (e.g., Lv4/Lv2 autonomous driving, public/private road driving, large vehicles, small robots).
  - Additionally, the ability to reduce functionalities for limited ODDs (e.g., obstacle-free managed private roads) is important from the platform point of view. Disabling modularized functions can reduce power consumption or requirement for sensing systems, which can fits to someone's needs.
- **Capability enhancement through cooperation with operators**
  - Assistance by operators is also a form of functional extension. This means that even in very complex and difficult use cases, the system can cope through functional extension by human assistance. The specific type of operator is not defined here. It might be a person accompanying in the vehicle during the prototype development phase or a remote operator connected in emergencies during autonomous driving services.

**Non-goals:**

The Planning Component is intended to be extended by third-party modules. Therefore, the following are excluded from the goals of Autoware's Planning Component alone:

- Providing all the functionalities needed by users solely with Autoware
- Complete functionality and performance as an autonomous driving system
- Performance consistently exceeding human capabilities or providing complete safety.

Note that these requirements come from the perspective of an autonomous driving "platform" and are not generally applicable to the Planning Component of a typical autonomous driving system.

## High level design

This diagram shows the high-level architecture of the Planning Component. Note that this is an ideal high-level design and the current implementation does not fully comply with it. Please refer to the latter part for detailed implementations.

<!-- ![overall-planning-architecture](image/high-level-planning-diagram.drawio.svg) -->

![overall-planning-architecture](image/high-level-planning-diagram-miyake-reviewed.drawio.svg)

Here, we adopt a modular system framework following the microautonomy architecture. The functions of Planning are implemented as modules, which are dynamically/statically loaded/unloaded according to the given use cases. This includes, for example, lane change, intersection, and pedestrian crossing modules.

The Planning Component consists of several sub-components such as:

- **Mission Planning**: Calculates routes from the current location to the goal for autonomous driving missions based on map information. Comparing to existing services, this module takes on functions like FMS (Fleet Management System) mission management or car navigation route searching.
- **Planning Modules**: Plans the behavior of the vehicle, such as target trajectory and turn signals, for the defined mission. This sub-component consists of several modules responsible for functionalities. These modules are conveniently categorized into Behavior and Motion.
  - **Behavior**: Calculates appropriate routes considering traffic rules and safety. It handles safe confirmations and execution decisions for lane changes, entering intersections, and stopping at signals.
  - **Motion**: Calculates target trajectories considering vehicle motion and ride comfort in collaboration with Behavior modules. Specifically, it consists of lateral planning that calculates route shapes and longitudinal planning that calculates speeds.
- **Validation**: Validates the calculated target trajectories, ensuring safety and responding in emergencies. If the trajectory calculated by Planning is inappropriate, it notifies the System of an Emergency or generates a provisional trajectory.

### Highlights

Important points in this high-level design are listed below.

#### Modulation of each function

Functions necessary for Planning, such as route generation, lane changes, intersections, and pedestrian crossings, are managed as modules. These modules are provided with standardized interfaces, following which anyone can add or extend modules. Details of the interfaces will be discussed later.

#### Separation of Mission Planning sub-component

The role of Mission Planning is to substitute for existing services like FMS (Fleet Management System). By complying with the high-level defined interfaces of Mission Planning, easy integration with these third-party functions can be achieved.

#### Separation of Validation sub-component

Given the nature of the Planning Component, which can be easily extended by anyone, it is difficult to ensure the expected level of safety in each function. The Validation function of Planning is managed separately from modules that actually perform planning, ensuring a certain level of safety even if arbitrary changes are made to the modules.

#### Interface for HMI (Human Machine Interface)

The integration with Human Machine Interface is essential for smooth cooperation with human operators. Through the interfaces between these components, coordination with accompanying operators or remote monitoring systems is enabled.

#### Trade-offs for the separation of planning and other components

In the overall design of Autoware, attention is needed for the trade-offs when designing Planning as an isolated Component. By developing components such as Planning, Perception, Localization, and Control separately, cooperation with third-party components becomes easier. However, there are trade-offs between performance and extensibility. For example, ideally, the Perception component should only recognize objects needed by the Planning component, but separating components makes such close communication difficult, necessitating processing even unnecessary objects. Also, separating planning and control has performance drawbacks, such as difficulty in considering vehicle dynamics during planning. To compensate for this, increasing the amount of information in interfaces or increasing computational load is necessary.

## Customize features

One of the most important features of the Planning Component design is its integration with external modules. As shown in the diagram below, there are several ways to incorporate external functionalities.

![how-to-add-new-modules](image/how-to-add-new-modules.drawio.svg)

### 1. Adding New Modules to the Planning Component

Users can replace or add functionalities to Planning as modules. This is the most common method of extending functionalities. This allows for the addition of missing functionalities in the desired ODD or, conversely, the simplification of existing functionalities.

However, to add these functionalities, it is necessary that the interfaces of each module are properly organized. As of November 2023, such an ideal module system is not provided, and there are some limitations. For details, check the Reference Implementation section [Customize features in the current implementation](#customize-features-in-the-current-implementation).

### 2. Replacing Sub-components of Planning

Some users may be interested in collaboration and extension at the sub-component level. This could include, for example, replacing Mission Planning with an existing FMS service, or replacing the route generation functionality with a third-party product while using the existing Validation functionality.

Following the [Internal interface in the planning component](#internal-interface-in-the-planning-component) described later, it is possible to collaborate and extend at the sub-component level. While complex coordination with existing Planning functionalities is not feasible, it enables collaboration between some functionalities of the Planning Component and external modules.

### 3. Replacing the Entire Planning Component

Companies or research labs developing autonomous driving Planning systems may be interested in evaluating the entire autonomous driving system by integrating their own Planning products with Autoware's Perception or Control modules. This is possible by replacing the entire Planning system. It is easy to replace by following the most robust and stable interfaces defined between components. However, coordination with existing planning modules is not possible.

## Component interface

This section describes the inputs and outputs of the Planning Component and of its internal modules. See the [Planning Component Interface](../../autoware-interfaces/components/planning.md) page for the current implementation.

### Input to the planning component

- **From Map**
  - Vector map: Contains all static information about the environment, including lane connection information for route planning, lane geometry for generating a reference path, and traffic rule-related information.
- **From Perception**
  - Detected object information: Provides real-time information about objects that cannot be known in advance, such as pedestrians and other vehicles. The Planning Component plans maneuvers to avoid collisions with these objects.
  - Detected obstacle information: Supplies real-time information about the location of obstacles, which is more primitive than Detected Object and used for emergency stops and other safety measures.
  - Occupancy map information: Offers real-time information about the presence of pedestrians and other vehicles and occluded area information.
  - Traffic light recognition result: Provides the current state of each traffic light in real time. The Planning Component extracts relevant information for the planned path and determines whether to stop at intersections.
- **From Localization**
  - Vehicle motion information: Includes the ego vehicle's position, velocity, acceleration, and other motion-related data.
- **From System**
  - Operation mode: Indicates whether the vehicle is operating in Autonomous mode.
- **From Human Machine Interface (HMI)**
  - Feature execution: Allows for executing/authorizing autonomous driving operations, such as lane changes or entering intersections, by human operators.
- **From API Layer**
  - Destination (Goal): Represents the final position that the Planning Component aims to reach.
  - Checkpoint: Represents a midpoint along the route to the destination. This is used during route calculation.
  - Velocity limit: Sets the maximum speed limit for the vehicle.

### Output from the planning component

- **To Control**
  - Trajectory: Provides a smooth sequence of pose, twist, and acceleration that the Control Component must follow. The trajectory is typically 10 seconds long with a 0.1-second resolution.
  - Turn Signals: Controls the vehicle's turn indicators, such as right, left, hazard, etc. based on the planned maneuvers.
- **To System**
  - Diagnostics: Reports the state of the Planning Component, indicating whether the processing is running correctly and whether a safe plan is being generated.
- **To Human Machine Interface (HMI)**
  - Feature execution availability: Indicates the status of operations that can be executed or are required, such as lane changes or entering intersections.
  - Trajectory candidate: Shows the potential trajectory that will be executed after the user's execution.
- **To API Layer**
  - Planning factors: Provides information about the reasoning behind the current planning behavior. This may include the position of target objects to avoid, obstacles that led to the decision to stop, and other relevant information.

### Internal interface in the planning component

- **Mission Planning to Scenario Planning**
  - Route: Offers guidance for the path that needs to be followed from the starting point to the destination. This path is determined based on information such as lane IDs defined on the map. At the route level, it doesn't explicitly indicate which specific lanes to take, and the route can contain multiple lanes.
- **Behavior Planning to Motion Planning**
  - Path: Provides a rough position and velocity to be followed by the vehicle. These path points are usually defined with an interval of about 1 meter. Although other interval distances are possible, it may impact the precision or performance of the planning component.
  - Drivable area: Defines regions where the vehicle can drive, such as within lanes or physically drivable areas. It assumes that the motion planner will calculate the final trajectory within this defined area.
- **Scenario Planning to Validation**
  - Trajectory: Defines the desired positions, velocities, and accelerations which the Control Component will try to follow. Trajectory points are defined at intervals of approximately 0.1 seconds based on the trajectory velocities.
- **Validation to Control Component**
  - Trajectory: Same as above but with some additional safety considerations.

### Important information in the current implementation

An important difference compared to the high-level design is the "introduction of the scenario layer" and the "clear separation of behavior and motion." These are introduced due to current performance and implementation challenges. Whether to define these as part of the high-level design or to improve them as part of the implementation is a matter of discussion.

#### Introducing the Scenario Planning layer

There are different requirements for interfaces between driving in well-structured lanes and driving in a free-space area like a parking lot. For example, while Lane Driving can handle routes with map IDs, this is not appropriate for planning in free space. The mechanism that switches planning sub-components at the scenario level (Lane Driving, Parking, etc) enables a flexible design of the interface, however, it has a drawbacks of the reuse of modules across different scenarios.

#### Separation of Behavior and Motion

One of the classic approach to Planning involves dividing it into "Behavior", which decides the action, and "Motion", which determines the final movement. However, this separation implies a trade-off with performance, as performance tends to degrade with increasing separation of functions. For example, Behavior needs to make decisions without prior knowledge of the computations that Motion will eventually perform, which generally results in conservative decision-making. On the other hand, if behavior and motion are integrated, motion performance and decision-making become interdependent, creating challenges in terms of expandability, such as when you wish to extend only the decision-making function to follow a regional traffic rules.

To understand this background, this [previously discussed document](https://github.com/tier4/AutowareArchitectureProposal.proj/blob/main/docs/design/software_architecture/Planning/DesignRationale.md) may be useful.

### Customize features in the current implementation

While it is possible to add module-level functionalities in the current implementation, a unified interface for all functionalities is not provided. Here's a brief explanation of the methods of extending at the module level in the current implementation.

![reference-implementation-add-new-modules](image/reference-implementation-add-new-modules.drawio.svg)

#### Add new modules in behavior_velocity_planner or behavior_path_plnner

ROS nodes such as [behavior_path_planner](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware.universe/main/planning/behavior_path_planner/) and [behavior_velocity_planner](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware.universe/main/planning/behavior_velocity_planner/) have a module interface available through plugins. By adding modules in accordance with the module interfaces defined in these ROS nodes, dynamic loading/unloading of modules becomes possible. For specific methods of adding modules, please refer to the documentation of each package.

#### Add a new ros node in the planning component

When adding modules in Motion Planning, it is necessary to create the module as a ROS Node and integrate it into the planning component. The current configuration involves adding information to the target trajectory calculated upstream, and the introduction of a ROS Node in this process allows for the expansion of functionality.

#### Add or replace with scenarios

The current implementation has introduced a scenario-level switching logic as a method for collectively switching multiple modules. This allows for the addition of new scenarios (e.g., highway driving).

By creating a scenario as a ros node and aligning the scenario_selector ros node with it, the integration is complete. The benefit of this is that you can introduce significant new functionalities without affecting the implementation of other scenarios (like Lane Driving). However, it only allows for scenario-level coordination through scenario switching and does not enable coordination at the existing planning module level.

### Notation

#### [1] self-crossing road and overlapped

To support the self-crossing road and overlapped road in the opposite direction, each planning module has to meet the [specifications](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware.universe/main/common/motion_utils/)

Currently, the supported modules are as follows.

- lane_following (in behavior_path_planner)
- detection_area (in behavior_velocity_planner)
- stop_line (in behavior_velocity_planner)
- virtual_traffic_light (in behavior_velocity_planner)
- obstacle_avoidance_planner
- obstacle_stop_planner
- motion_velocity_smoother

#### [2] Size of Path Points

Some functions do not support paths with only one point. Therefore, each modules should generate the path with more than two path points. -->
