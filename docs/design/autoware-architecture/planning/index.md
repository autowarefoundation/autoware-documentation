# Planning component design

## Overview

The Planning component generates the trajectory message that will be subscribed to by the Control component based on the environmental state obtained from the Localization and the Perception components.

## Requirements

The goal of the Planning component is to generate a trajectory (path and velocity) of the ego vehicle that is safe and well-regulated while satisfying the given mission.

**Goals:**

- The basic functions are provided so that a simple ODD can be defined.
- The functionality is modularized to accommodate the third-party components. That is, a complicated or realistic ODD needs not be defined by the basic functions provided by default.
- The capability is extensible with the third-party components or the decision of human operators.
- The mechanism and policy are separated to allow the system or operators to change the behavior of the ego vehicle. Ultimately speaking, the policy can be set to crash an obstacle and the mechanism always follows. Otherwise, the system is not safe from the design point of view.

**Non-goals:**

- The Planning component is not self-contained but can be extended with third parties.
- The Planning component is not aimed at the complete functionality and capability.
- The Planning component is not designed to always outperform human drivers.
- The Planning component is not capable of “never crashes”.

## High-level architecture

This diagram describes the high-level architecture of the Planning Component.

![overall-planning-architecture](image/high-level-planning-diagram.drawio.svg)

The Planning component consists of the following sub-components:

- **Mission Planning**: Calculates the route based on the given goal and map information.
- **Scenario Planning**: Determines the trajectory based on the current scenario, such as Lane Driving or Parking.
  - **Lane Driving**: Calculates the trajectory for driving within constructed lanes.
    - **Behavior Planner**: Calculates suitable trajectory based on safety considerations and traffic rules.
    - **Motion Planner**: Calculates suitable trajectory for the vehicle by taking into account safety factors, vehicle motion considerations, and instructions from the behavior planner.
  - **Parking**: Calculates the trajectory for parking in unstructured areas.
- **Validation**: Verifies the safety of the trajectory.

Each component contains some modules that can be dynamically loaded and unloaded based on the situation. For instance, the Behavior Planning component includes modules such as lane change, intersection, and crosswalk modules.

Our planning components are built based on the microautonomy architecture with Autoware. We adopt a modular system framework where the tasks are implemented as modules that can be dynamically loaded and unloaded to achieve different features depending on the given use cases.

## Component interface

This section describes the inputs and outputs of the Planning Component and of its internal modules. See the [Planning Component Interface](../../autoware-interfaces/components/planning.md) page for the current implementation.

### Input to the planning component

- **From Map**
  - Vector map: Contains all static information about the environment, including lane connection information for route planning, lane geometry for generating a reference path, and traffic rule-related information.
- **From Perception**
  - Detected object information: Provides real-time information about objects that cannot be known in advance, such as pedestrians and other vehicles. The Planning Component plans maneuvers to avoid collisions with these objects.
  - Detected obstacle information: Supplies real-time information about the location of obstacles, which is more primitive than Detected Object and used for emergency stops and other safety measures.
  - Occupancy map information: Offers real-time information about the presence of pedestrians and other vehicles and occluded area information.
  - Traffic light recognition result: Provides the current state of each traffic light in real time. The Planning Component extracts relevant information for the planned path and determines whether to stop at intersections.
- **From Localization**
  - Vehicle motion information: Includes the ego vehicle's position, velocity, acceleration, and other motion-related data.
- **From System**
  - Operation mode: Indicates whether the vehicle is operating in Autonomous mode.
- **From Human Machine Interface (HMI)**
  - Feature execution: Allows for executing/authorizing autonomous driving operations, such as lane changes or entering intersections, by human operators.
- **From API Layer**
  - Goal: Represents the final position that the Planning Component aims to reach.
  - Checkpoint: Represents a midpoint along the route to the destination. This is used during route calculation.
  - Velocity limit: Sets the maximum speed limit for the vehicle.

### Output from the planning component

- **To Control**
  - Trajectory: Provides a smooth sequence of pose, twist, and acceleration that the Control Component must follow. The trajectory is typically 10 seconds long with a 0.1-second resolution.
  - Turn Signals: Controls the vehicle's turn indicators, such as right, left, hazard, etc. based on the planned maneuvers.
- **To System**
  - Diagnostics: Reports the state of the Planning Component, indicating whether the processing is running correctly and whether a safe plan is being generated.
- **To Human Machine Interface (HMI)**
  - Feature execution availability: Indicates the status of operations that can be executed or are required, such as lane changes or entering intersections.
  - Trajectory candidate: Shows the potential trajectory that will be executed after the user's execution.
- **To API Layer**
  - Planning factors: Provides information about the reasoning behind the current planning behavior. This may include the position of target objects to avoid, obstacles that led to the decision to stop, and other relevant information.

### Internal interface in the planning component

- **Mission Planning to Scenario Planning**
  - Route: Offers guidance for the path that needs to be followed from the starting point to the destination. This path is determined based on information such as lane IDs defined on the map. At the route level, it doesn't explicitly indicate which specific lanes to take, and the route can contain multiple lanes.
- **Behavior Planning to Motion Planning**
  - Path: Provides a rough position and velocity to be followed by the vehicle. These path points are usually defined with an interval of about 1 meter. Although other interval distances are possible, it may impact the precision or performance of the planning component.
  - Drivable area: Defines regions where the vehicle can drive, such as within lanes or physically drivable areas. It assumes that the motion planner will calculate the final trajectory within this defined area.
- **Scenario Planning to Validation**
  - Trajectory: Defines the desired positions, velocities, and accelerations which the Control Component will try to follow. Trajectory points are defined at intervals of approximately 0.1 seconds based on the trajectory velocities.
- **Validation to Control Component**
  - Trajectory: Same as above but with some additional safety considerations.

## How to add new modules (WIP)

As mentioned in the goal session, this planning module is designed to be extensible by third-party components. For specific instructions on how to add new modules and expand its functionality, please refer to the provided documentation or guidelines (WIP).

### Notation

#### [1] self-crossing road and overlapped

To support the self-crossing road and overlapped road in the opposite direction, each planning module has to meet the [specifications](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware.universe/main/common/motion_utils/)

Currently, the supported modules are as follows.

- lane_following (in behavior_path_planner)
- detection_area (in behavior_velocity_planner)
