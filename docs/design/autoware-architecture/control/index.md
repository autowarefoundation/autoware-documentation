## Autoware Control Design

The Control Component generates the control signal to which the Vehicle Component subscribes. The generated control signals are computed based on the reference trajectories from the Planning Component.

The Control Component consists of two modules. The `trajectory_follower` module generates a vehicle control command to follow the reference trajectory received from the planning module. The command includes, for example, the desired steering angle and target speed. The `vehicle_command_gate` is responsible for filtering the control command to prevent abnormal values and then sending it to the vehicle. This gate also allows switching between multiple sources such as the MRM (minimal risk maneuver) module or some remote control module, in addition to the trajectory follower.

The Autoware control system is designed as a platform for automated driving systems that can be compatible with a diverse range of vehicles.

The control process in Autoware uses general information (such as target acceleration and deceleration) and no vehicle-specific information (such as brake pressure) is used. Hence it can be adjusted independently of the vehicle's drive interface enabling easy integration or performance tuning.

Furthermore, significant differences that affect vehicle motion constraints, such as two-wheel steering or four-wheel steering, are addressed by switching the control vehicle model, achieving control specialized for each characteristic.

Autoware's control module outputs the necessary information to control the vehicle as a substitute for a human driver. For example, the control command from the control module looks like the following:

```msg
- Target steering angle
- Target steering torque
- Target speed
- Target acceleration
```

Note that vehicle-specific values such as pedal positions and low-level information such as individual wheel rotation speeds are excluded from the command.

## Vehicle Adaptation Design

### Vehicle interface adapter

Autoware is designed to be an autonomous driving platform able to accommodate vehicles with various drivetrain types.

This is an explanation of how Autoware handles the standardization of systems with different vehicle drivetrains. The interfaces for vehicle drivetrains are diverse, including steering angle, steering angular velocity, steering torque, speed, accel/brake pedals, and brake pressure. To accommodate these differences, Autoware adds an adapter module between the control component and the vehicle interface. This module performs the conversion between the proprietary message types used by the vehicle (such as brake pressure) and the generic types used by Autoware (such as desired acceleration). By providing this conversion information, the differences in vehicle drivetrain can be accommodated.

If the information is not known in advance, an automatic calibration tool can be used. Calibration will occur within limited degrees of freedom, generating the information necessary for the drivetrain conversion automatically.

This configuration is summarized in the following diagram.

The list above does not cover wheel control systems such as ABS commonly used in vehicles. Regarding these features, the following considerations are taken into account.

### Integration with vehicle-side functions

ABS (Anti-lock Brake System) and ESC (Electric Stability Control) are two functions that may be pre-installed on a vehicle, directly impacting its controllability.
The control modules of Autoware assume that both ABS and ESC are installed on the vehicle and their absence may cause unreliable controls depending on the target ODD. For example, with low-velocity driving in a controlled environment, these functions are not necessary.

Also, note that this statement does not negate the development of ABS functionality in autonomous driving systems.

### Autoware Capabilities and Vehicle Requirements

As an alternative to human driving, autonomous driving systems essentially aim to handle tasks that humans can perform. This includes not only controlling the steering wheel, accel, and brake, but also automatically detecting issues such as poor brake response or a misaligned steering angle. However, this is a trade-off, as better vehicle performance will lead to superior system behavior, ultimately affecting the design of ODD.

On the other hand, for tasks that are not typically anticipated or cannot be handled by a human driver, processing in the vehicle ECU is expected. Examples of such scenarios include cases where the brake response is clearly delayed or when the vehicle rotates due to a single-side tire slipping. These tasks are typically handled by ABS or ESC.
