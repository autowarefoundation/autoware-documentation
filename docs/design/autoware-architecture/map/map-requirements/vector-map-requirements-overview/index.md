# Vector Map creation requirement specifications

## Overview

Autoware relies on high-definition point cloud maps and vector maps of the driving environment to perform various tasks such as localization, route planning, traffic light detection, and predicting the trajectories of pedestrians and other vehicles.

A vector map contains highly accurate information about a road network, lane geometry, and traffic lights. It is required for route planning, traffic light detection, and predicting the trajectories of other vehicles and pedestrians.

Vector Map uses [lanelet2_extension](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_lanelet2_extension/blob/main/autoware_lanelet2_extension/docs/lanelet2_format_extension.md), which is based on the [lanelet2](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2) format and extended for Autoware.

The primitives (basic components) used in Vector Map are explained in [Web.Auto Docs - What is Lanelet2](https://docs.web.auto/en/user-manuals/vector-map-builder/introduction#what-is-lanelet2). The following **Vector Map creation requirement specifications** are written on the premise of these knowledge.

This specification is a set of requirements for the creation of Vector Map(s) to ensure that Autoware drives safely and autonomously as intended by the user. To Create a Lanelet2 format .osm file, please refer to [Creating a vector map](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/latest/how-to-guides/integrating-autoware/creating-maps/#creating-a-vector-map).

## Handling of the Requirement Specification

Which requirements apply entirely depends on the configuration of the Autoware system on a vehicle. Before creating a Vector Map, it is necessary to clearly determine in advance how you want the vehicle with the implemented system to behave in various environments.

Next, you must comply with the laws of the country where the autonomous driving vehicle will be operating. It is your responsibility to choose which of the following requirements to apply according to the laws.

### Caution

- The examples of the road signs and road surface markings are used in Japan. Please replace them with those used in your respective countries.
- The values for range and distance indicated are minimum values. Please determine values that comply with the laws of your country. Furthermore, these minimum values may change depending on the maximum velocity of the autonomous driving vehicle.
