# Reference Design

Autoware has been developed and deployed in several autonomous vehicle projects. These projects range from prototypes, research platforms, education platforms, racing vehicles, commercial vehicles and utility vehicles. The pages in this section elaborate their designs, including hardware and software, for these projects.

Two spider/radar charts are provided for each project to provide high-level overview of the design and technologies used in each project. The metrics for the chart are defined on [this page](metrics.md).
