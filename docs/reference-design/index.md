# Reference design

Autoware has been developed and deployed in several autonomous vehicle projects. These projects range from prototypes, research platforms, education platforms, racing vehicles, commercial vehicles and utility vehicles.
The pages in this section elaborate their designs, including hardware and software, for these projects.

Two spider/radar charts are provided for each project to provide high-level overview of the design and technologies used in each project. The metrics for the chart are defined on the [Metrics Page](metrics.md).

- **Privately Owned Vehicles** Reference Design Documentation

  ***

  A modular design guideline for building a TRL-6 privately-owned vehicle using Autoware. This document defines how to choose sensors, ECUs, actuators and software stack; how to define the Operational Design Domain (ODD); and how to conduct evaluation and testing. But it does _not_ mandate a specific vehicle chassis. Covers a phased roadmap: from single-camera “Vision Pilot” (SAE Level 2+/2++) through multi-sensor configurations up to “Vision Drive” targeting Level 4 autonomy.

- **Low Speed Autonomy** Reference Design Documentation

  ***

  A design guideline for building TRL-6 low-speed autonomous platforms (e.g. parking-lot robots, shuttles, small vehicles) using Autoware. Supports both indoor and outdoor use-cases, with flexible chassis and hardware configurations, adaptable ECUs, sensors and actuators. Includes guidance on software stack setup, middleware choices, optional custom workflows, and evaluation/testing procedures. Provides a solid starting point for small-scale autonomous mobility or robotics projects.
