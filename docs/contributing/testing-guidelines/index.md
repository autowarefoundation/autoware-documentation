# Testing guidelines

## Unit testing

Unit testing is a software testing method that tests individual units of source code to determine whether they satisfy the specification.

For details,see the [Unit testing guidelines](unit-testing.md).

## Integration testing

Integration testing combines and tests the individual software modules as a group, and is done after unit testing.

While performing integration testing, the following subtypes of tests are written:

1. Fault injection testing
2. Back-to-back comparison between a model and code
3. Requirements-based testing
4. Anomaly detection during integration testing
5. Random input testing

For details, see the [Integration testing guidelines](integration-testing.md).
