# Documentation guidelines

Contributions to Autoware's documentation are welcome, and the same principles [described in the contribution guidelines](../contributing/#pull-requests) should be followed. Small, limited changes can be made by forking this repository and submitting a pull request, but larger changes should be discussed with the community and Autoware maintainers via GitHub Discussion first.

Examples of small changes include:

- Fixing spelling or grammatical mistakes
- Fixing broken links
- Making an addition to an existing, well-defined page, such as the [Troubleshooting](../../support/troubleshooting.md) guide.

Examples of larger changes include:

- Adding new pages with a large amount of detail, such as a tutorial
- Re-organization of the existing documentation structure

In terms of style, you should refer to the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style) as much as possible. Reading the [Highlights page](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights) of that guide is recommended, but if not then the key points below should be noted.

- [Use standard American English spelling](https://developers.google.com/style/spelling) and punctuation.
- [Use sentence case](https://developers.google.com/style/capitalization) for document titles and section headings.
- [Use descriptive link text](https://developers.google.com/style/link-text).
- [Write short sentences](https://developers.google.com/style/translation#write-short,-clear,-and-precise-sentences) that are easy to understand and translate.
