# License

Autoware is licensed under Apache License 2.0.
Thus all contributions will be licensed as such as per clause 5 of the Apache License 2.0:

```text
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
```

Here is an example copyright header to add to the top of a new file:

```text
Copyright [first year of contribution] The Autoware Contributors
SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

We don't write copyright notations of each contributor here.
Instead, we place them in the `NOTICE` file like the following.

```text
This product includes code developed by [company name].
Copyright [first year of contribution] [company name]
```

Let us know if your legal department has a special request for the copyright notation.

Currently, the old formats explained [here](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/-/blob/87c5e5880a18068116dd886ad56e1bfc29e694c4/CONTRIBUTING.md) are also acceptable.
Those old formats can be replaced by this new format if the original authors agree.  
Note that we won't write their copyrights to the `NOTICE` file unless they agree with the new format.
