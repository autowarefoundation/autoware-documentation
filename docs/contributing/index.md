## What Should I Know Before I Get Started

### Autoware concepts

Although it may be reasonable to assume that anyone reading this page already knows something about Autoware, that may not be true and so we recommend reading the following pages to get a better idea of what Autoware actually is, the philosophy behind the structure of Autoware and something.

- [Autoware architecture](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/)
- [Autoware concepts](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/autoware-concepts/)

### Contributing to open source projects

If you are new to open source projects, we recommend reading GitHub's [How to Contribute to Open Source guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) for an overview of why people contribute to open source projects, what it means to contribute and much more besides.

## How can I contribute?

### Discussions

You can contribute to Autoware by facilitating and participating in discussions, such as:

- Proposing a new feature to enhance Autoware.
- Joining an existing discussion and express your opinion.
- Organizing discussions for other contributors.
- [Answering questions and supporting other contributors](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/discussions/categories/q-a?discussions_q=category%3AQ%26A+is%3Aunanswered).

### Working groups

The [various working groups](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware-projects/wiki#working-group-list) within the Autoware Foundation are responsible for managing low level activities as directed by the Foundation's Technical Steering Committee. These working groups are open to everyone, and joining a particular working group will allow you to gain an understanding of projects that are currently in progress, and to see how those projects are managed within each group.

To see the schedule for upcoming working group meetings, refer to the [Autoware Foundation events calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=autoware.org_6lol0ho5ft0217h8c60pi1fm30@group.calendar.google.com).

### Reporting bugs

Before creating an issue 
- Find a bug and open a new issue.

### Pull requests

Pull requests can be submitted directly for small changes such as:

- Minor documentation updates.
- Fixing spelling mistakes.
- Fixing CI failures.
- Fixing warnings detected by compilers or analysis tools.
- Making small changes to a single package.

If your pull request is not covered by the examples above or is a large change, create an issue or a discussion thread to discuss possible approaches with the maintainers before submitting a pull request. Doing so ensures that the proposed change will be in line with Autoware's design philosophy and current development plans. Lastly, ensure that you use the appropriate pull request template for the target repository.

For more detailed information on how to submit a good pull request, have a read of our [pull request guidelines](pull-request-guidelines/index.md) and don't forget to review the required [license notations](license.md)!
