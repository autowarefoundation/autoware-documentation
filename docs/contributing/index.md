First off, thank you for your interest in contributing to Autoware! Like any other open-source project, Autoware can only continue to thrive through the work of people like yourself, and all types of contribution are welcome no matter how big or small.

## Code of Conduct

To ensure our community stays open and inclusive, our [code of conduct](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) adheres to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) that has been adopted by [many other open source communities](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopters/). By participating in the Autoware community, you agree to follow this code.

If you believe that someone in the community has violated the code of conduct, please make a report by emailing conduct@autoware.org.

## What Should I Know Before I Get Started?

### Autoware concepts

To gain a high-level understanding of Autoware's architecture and design, the following pages provide a brief overview:

- [Autoware architecture](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/)
- [Autoware concepts](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/autoware-concepts/)

For experienced developers, the [Autoware interfaces](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/autoware-interfaces/) and [individual component pages](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/autoware-interfaces/components/) should also be reviewed to understand the inputs and outputs for each component or module at a more detailed level.

### Contributing to open source projects

If you are new to open source projects, we recommend reading GitHub's [How to Contribute to Open Source guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) for an overview of why people contribute to open source projects, what it means to contribute and much more besides.

## How can I get help?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for confirmed bug reports. Instead, open a discussion in the Q&A category. For more details on our support mechanisms and links to troubleshooting guides, refer to our [Support guidelines](../support/index.md).

!!! note

    Issues created for questions or unconfirmed bugs will be moved to GitHub discussions by the maintainers.

## How can I contribute?

### Discussions

You can contribute to Autoware by facilitating and participating in discussions, such as:

- [Proposing a new feature to enhance Autoware](https://github.com/orgs/autowarefoundation/discussions/categories/feature-requests).
- [Joining an existing discussion and expressing your opinion](https://github.com/orgs/autowarefoundation/discussions).
- Organizing discussions for other contributors.
- [Answering questions and supporting other contributors](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/discussions/categories/q-a?discussions_q=category%3AQ%26A+is%3Aunanswered).

### Working groups

The [various working groups](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware-projects/wiki#working-group-list) within the Autoware Foundation are responsible for managing low level activities as directed by the foundation's Technical Steering Committee. These working groups are open to everyone, and joining a particular working group will allow you to gain an understanding of current projects, see how those projects are managed within each group and contribute to issues that will help progress a particular project.

To see the schedule for upcoming working group meetings, refer to the [Autoware Foundation events calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=autoware.org_6lol0ho5ft0217h8c60pi1fm30@group.calendar.google.com).

### Reporting bugs

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker for the appropriate repository. It is possible that someone has already reported the same issue and that workarounds exist. If you can't determine the appropriate repository, ask the maintainers for help by creating a new discussion in the [Q&A category](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/discussions/categories/q-a).

When reporting a bug, you should provide a minimal set of instructions to reproduce the issue. Doing so allows us to quickly confirm and focus on the right problem.

If you want to fix the bug by yourself, then that will be appreciated, but you should discuss possible approaches with the maintainers first before submitting a pull request.

You can file new issues by selecting from our new issue templates and filling out the issue template.

### Pull requests

Pull requests can be submitted directly for small changes such as:

- Minor documentation updates.
- Fixing spelling mistakes.
- Fixing CI failures.
- Fixing warnings detected by compilers or analysis tools.
- Making small changes to a single package.

If your pull request is not covered by the examples above or is a large change, create an issue or a discussion thread to discuss possible approaches with the maintainers before submitting a pull request. Doing so ensures that the proposed change will be in line with Autoware's design philosophy and current development plans. Lastly, ensure that you use the appropriate pull request template for the target repository.

We have some additional guidelines specific to the type of change being made, so please make sure to review those before submitting your pull request.

- [Coding guidelines](coding-guidelines/index.md)
- [Testing guidelines](testing-guidelines/index.md)
- [Documentation guidelines](documentation-guidelines/index.md)

For more information on how to submit a good pull request, have a read of our [pull request guidelines](pull-request-guidelines/index.md) and don't forget to review the required [license notations](license.md)!
