# Contributing

This page explains how to contribute to Autoware.

First, conform to the [Code of conduct](#contribution-workflows) section for the general manners in contributions.

See the [Contribution workflows](#contribution-workflows) section for the workflows.  
Also, make sure the contribution is in line with the following guidelines:

- [Coding guidelines](coding-guidelines/index.md): for contributing source code
- [Testing guidelines](testing-guidelines/index.md): for contributing tests
- [Documentation guidelines](documentation-guidelines/index.md): for contributing documents
- [Pull request guidelines](pull-request-guidelines/index.md): for submitting pull requests
- [Discussion guidelines](discussion-guidelines/index.md): for discussing with other contributors
- [Support guidelines](../help/support-guidelines.md): for finding the right channel when you need help

It is recommended to read the [Contributing pages in ROS 2 Docs](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Contributing.html) as well because Autoware's guidelines generally depend on them.

For general information about OSS contributions, [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) by GitHub is a good resource.

!!!info

    If you want to make changes to the guidelines in this documentation site, you can open a new discussion thread and propose it.

## Code of conduct

We welcome contributions from everyone.  
To ensure our community stays open and healthy, we adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), a widely used [code of conduct](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) adopted by many other communities listed [here](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopters/).

Everyone participating in the Autoware community is expected to follow the code of conduct.  
If someone in the community happens to be violating these terms, let the maintainers know, and we will address it as soon as possible.

!!!warning

    Note that contributions that ignore guidelines are not contributions but nuisances.

## Contribution workflows

There are several types of contributions and the workflows differ between the types.
See the description for your contribution type.

### Discussions

You can contribute to Autoware by facilitating discussions:

- Find a bug and open a new issue.
- Propose an idea of features that will enhance Autoware.
- Join an existing discussion and express your opinion.
- Organize discussions for other contributors.
- Answer questions and support other contributors.

See our [support guidelines](../help/support-guidelines.md) for the detailed steps.

### Pull requests

You can submit a pull request directly (without opening an issue) if it is small like the following:

- Update a small part of documents.
- Fix spelling mistakes.
- Fix CI failures.
- Fix warnings detected by compilers or analysis tools.
- Make small changes to a single package.

Otherwise, create an issue or a discussion thread before submitting a pull request and discuss the approach with maintainers.

Also, regardless of the size of your pull request, follow the pull request template of the target repository.

See our [pull request guidelines](pull-request-guidelines/index.md) for the detailed steps.  
See [License](license.md) for the license notations.
