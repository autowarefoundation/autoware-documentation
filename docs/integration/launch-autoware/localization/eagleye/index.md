# Using Eagleye with Autoware

This page will show you how to set up [Eagleye](https://github.com/MapIV/eagleye) in order to use it with Autoware.
For the details of the integration proposal, please refer to [this discussion](https://github.com/orgs/autowarefoundation/discussions/3257).

## What is Eagleye?

Eagleye is an open-source GNSS/IMU-based localizer initially developed by [MAP IV. Inc](https://map4.jp/). It provides a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR and point cloud-based localization by using low-cost GNSS and IMU sensors to provide vehicle position, orientation, and altitude information.

### Dependencies

The below packages are automatically installed during the setup of Autoware as they are listed in [autoware.repos](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/blob/main/autoware.repos).

1. [Eagleye](https://github.com/MapIV/eagleye.git) (autoware-main branch)
2. [RTKLIB ROS Bridge](https://github.com/MapIV/rtklib_ros_bridge.git) (ros2-v0.1.0 branch)
3. [LLH Converter](https://github.com/MapIV/llh_converter.git) (ros2 branch)

## Architecture

Eagleye can be utilized in the Autoware localization stack in two ways:

1. Feed only twist into the EKF localizer.

2. Feed both twist and pose from Eagleye into the EKF localizer (twist can also be used with regular `gyro_odometry`).

**Note: RTK positioning is required when using Eagleye as the pose estimator.**
On the other hand, it is not mandatory when using it as the twist estimator.

## Requirements

Eagleye requires GNSS, IMU and vehicle speed as inputs.

### IMU topic

`sensor_msgs/msg/Imu` is supported for Eagleye IMU input.

### Vehicle speed topic

`geometry_msgs/msg/TwistStamped` and `geometry_msgs/msg/TwistWithCovarianceStamped` are supported for the input vehicle speed.

### GNSS topic

Eagleye requires latitude/longitude height and doppler velocity generated by the GNSS receiver.
Your GNSS ROS driver must publish the following messages:

- `sensor_msgs/msg/NavSatFix`: This message contains latitude, longitude, and height information.
- `geometry_msgs/msg/TwistWithCovarianceStamped`: This message contains gnss doppler velocity information.
  <!-- cspell: ignore ublox -->
  Eagleye has been tested with the following example GNSS ROS drivers: ublox_gps and septentrio_gnss_driver. The settings needed for each of these drivers are as follows:

| GNSS ROS drivers                                                                              | modification                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ublox_gps](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/ublox/tree/ros2/ublox_gps)                       | No additional settings are required. It publishes `sensor_msgs/msg/NavSatFix` and `geometry_msgs/msg/TwistWithCovarianceStamped` required by Eagleye with default settings.      |
| [septentrio_gnss_driver](https://github.com/septentrio-gnss/septentrio_gnss_driver/tree/ros2) | Set `publish.navsatfix` and `publish.twist` in the config file [`gnss.yaml`](https://github.com/septentrio-gnss/septentrio_gnss_driver/blob/ros2/config/gnss.yaml#L90) to `true` |

## Parameter Modifications for Integration into Your Vehicle

### topic name & topic type

The users must correctly specify input topics for GNSS latitude, longitude, and height , GNSS doppler speed , IMU , and vehicle speed in the [`eagleye_config.yaml`](https://github.com/MapIV/autoware_launch/blob/3f04a9dd7bc4a4c49d4ec790e3f6b9958ab822da/autoware_launch/config/localization/eagleye_config.param.yaml#L7-L16).

```yaml
# Topic
twist:
  twist_type: 1 # TwistStamped : 0, TwistWithCovarianceStamped: 1
  twist_topic: /sensing/vehicle_velocity_converter/twist_with_covariance
imu_topic: /sensing/imu/tamagawa/imu_raw
gnss:
  velocity_source_type: 2 # rtklib_msgs/RtklibNav: 0, nmea_msgs/Sentence: 1, ublox_msgs/NavPVT: 2, geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovarianceStamped: 3
  velocity_source_topic: /sensing/gnss/ublox/navpvt
  llh_source_type: 2 # rtklib_msgs/RtklibNav: 0, nmea_msgs/Sentence: 1, sensor_msgs/NavSatFix: 2
  llh_source_topic: /sensing/gnss/ublox/nav_sat_fix
```

### sensor frequency

Also, the frequency of GNSS and IMU must be set in [`eagleye_config.yaml`](https://github.com/MapIV/autoware_launch/blob/3f04a9dd7bc4a4c49d4ec790e3f6b9958ab822da/autoware_launch/config/localization/eagleye_config.param.yaml#L36)

```yaml
common:
  imu_rate: 50
  gnss_rate: 5
```

### Conversion from fix to pose

The parameters for converting `sensor_msgs/msg/NavSatFix` to `geometry_msgs/msg/PoseWithCovarianceStamped` is listed in [`geo_pose_converter.launch.xml`](https://github.com/MapIV/eagleye/blob/autoware-main/eagleye_util/geo_pose_converter/launch/geo_pose_converter.launch.xml).
If you use a different geoid or projection type, change these parameters.

### Other parameters

The other parameters are described [here](https://github.com/MapIV/eagleye/tree/autoware-main/eagleye_rt/config).
Basically, these do not need to be changed .

## Notes on initialization

Eagleye requires an initialization process for proper operation. **Without initialization, the output for twist will be in the raw value, and the pose data will not be available.**

### 1. Static Initialization

The first step is static initialization, which involves allowing the Eagleye to remain stationary for approximately 5 seconds after startup to estimate the yaw-rate offset.

### 2. Dynamic initialization

The next step is dynamic initialization, which involves running the Eagleye in a straight line for approximately 30 seconds. This process estimates the scale factor of wheel speed and azimuth angle.

Once dynamic initialization is complete, the Eagleye will be able to provide corrected twist and pose data.

### How to check the progress of initialization

- **TODO**

## Note on georeferenced maps

Note that the output position might not appear to be in the point cloud maps if you are using maps that are not properly georeferenced.
In the case of a single GNSS antenna, initial position estimation (dynamic initialization) can take several seconds to complete after starting to run in an environment where GNSS positioning is available.
