## Documentation sites

[Docs guide](docs-guide.md) shows the list of useful documentation sites.
Visit them and see if there is any information related to your problem.

Note that the documentation sites aren't always up-to-date and perfect.
If you find out that some information is wrong, unclear, or missing in Autoware docs, feel free to submit a pull request following our [contribution guidelines](../contributing/index.md).

!!!warning

    Since this documentation site is still under construction, there are some empty pages.

## GitHub Discussions

If you encounter a problem with Autoware, check existing issues and questions and search for similar issues first.

- [Issues](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/issues)

  Note that Autoware has multiple repositories listed in [autoware.repos](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/blob/main/autoware.repos).  
  It is recommended to search across the repositories.

- [Questions](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/discussions/categories/q-a)

If no answer was found, create a new question thread [here](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/discussions/categories/q-a).
If your question is not answered within a week, then @mention the maintainers to remind them.

Also, there are other discussion types such as [feature requests](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/discussions/categories/feature-requests) or [design discussions](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/discussions/categories/design).
Feel free to open or join such discussions.

## GitHub Issues

If you have a problem and you have confirmed it is a bug, find the appropriate repository and create a new issue there.
If you can't determine the appropriate repository, ask the maintainers for help by creating a new discussion in the [Q&A category](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/discussions/categories/q-a).

!!!warning

    Do not create issues for questions or unconfirmed bugs. If such issues are created, maintainers will transfer them to GitHub Discussions.

If you want to fix the bug by yourself, discuss the approach with maintainers and submit a pull request.

## Slack

Autoware has a Slack workspace for casual communication between contributors.

For example, this is a good place for the following activities:

- Introduce yourself to the community.
- Chat with contributors.
- Take a quick straw poll.

Note that it is not the right place to get help for your issues.

## ROS Discourse

If you want to widely discuss a topic with the general Autoware and ROS community or ask a question not related to Autoware's bugs, post to [the Autoware category on ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/c/autoware).

!!!warning

    Do not post questions about bugs to ROS Discourse!
