# Document generation for autoware interfaces

Some of the documents under the `docs/design/autoware-interfaces` are generated by scripts.
If you would like to update these documents, please follow the steps below.

## Usage

Create a workspace anywhere and source the dependent message packages.

```bash
mkdir -p workspace/src
cd workspace/src
git clone https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_adapi_msgs.git
cd ..
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

Execute the script from the root of this repository.

```bash
cd "repository root"
python3 tools/autoware-interfaces/generate.py
```

A document will be generated in the following paths.

```txt
yaml/autoware-interfaces.yaml
docs/design/autoware-architecture-v1/interfaces/ad-api/types/**/*.md
```
