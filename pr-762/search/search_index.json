So it turns out that you are indirectly using the <code>take()</code> method, whether you know it or not.</p> <pre><code>    std::shared_ptr&lt;void&gt; message = subscription-&gt;create_message();\n    take_and_do_error_handling(\n      \"taking a message from topic\",\n      subscription-&gt;get_topic_name(),\n      [&amp;]() {return subscription-&gt;take_type_erased(message.get(), message_info);},\n      [&amp;]() {subscription-&gt;handle_message(message, message_info);});\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>Strictly speaking, the <code>take_type_erased()</code> method is called in the executor, but not the <code>take()</code> method.</p> <p>But <code>take_type_erased()</code> is the embodiment of <code>take()</code>, while <code>take()</code> internally calls <code>take_type_erased()</code>.</p> <p>If <code>rclcpp::Executor</code> based object, an executor, is programmed to call a callback function, the executor itself determines when to do it. Because the executor is essentially calling a best-effort callback function, the message is not guaranteed to be necessarily referenced or processed even though it is received. Therefore it is desirable to call the <code>take()</code> method directly to ensure that a message is referenced or processed at the intended time.</p> <p>As of May 2024, the recommended manners are beginning to be used in Autoware Universe.

Therefore, a lot of effort has been made to provide an integration-test framework that helps developers test the interaction of ROS 2 nodes.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/testing-guidelines/integration-testing/#integration-test-framework","title":"Integration-test framework","text":"<p>A typical integration-test framework has three parts:</p> <ol> <li>A series of executables with arguments that work together and generate outputs.</li> <li>A series of expected outputs that should match the output of the executables.</li> <li>A launcher that starts the tests, compares the outputs to the expected outputs, and determines if the test passes.</li> </ol> <p>In Autoware, we use the launch_testing framework.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/testing-guidelines/integration-testing/#smoke-tests","title":"Smoke tests","text":"<p>Autoware has a dedicated API for smoke testing.

Since there was no velocity source coming from the vehicle during all these tests, the twist message coming from GNSS/INS was given to ekf_localizer as the linear&amp;angular velocity source.  In order to understand whether this increases the error in cases where the GNSS/INS error increases in the tunnel and how it affects the system, localization in the tunnel was tested by giving only the pose from the NDT, without giving this velocity to ekf_localizer.  The video of this test is here.  As seen in the video, when velocity is not given, localization in the tunnel deteriorates more quickly. It is also predicted that if the IMU Twist message combined (/localization/twist_estimator/twist_with_covariance) with the linear velocity from the vehicle is given instead of the GNSS/INS Twist message, the performance in the tunnel will increase.

Localization is completely broken at the exit of the tunnel. I re-initialized the localization after vehicle exit the tunnel.</p> <p>From this point on, we move on to the bridge scenario.

However, if the built-in, automatic loop-closure fails or does not work correctly, you can use Interactive SLAM to adjust and optimize a pose graph manually.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/integrating-autoware/creating-maps/open-source-slam/#list-of-third-party-slam-implementations","title":"List of Third Party SLAM Implementations","text":"Package Name Explanation Repository Link Loop Closure Sensors ROS Version Dependencies DLIO Direct LiDAR-Inertial Odometry is a new lightweight LiDAR-inertial odometry algorithm with a novel coarse-to-fine approach in constructing continuous-time trajectories for precise motion correction github.com/vectr-ucla/direct_lidar_inertial_odometry \u2714\ufe0f LidarIMU ROS 2 PCLEigenOpenMP FAST-LIO-LC A computationally efficient and robust LiDAR-inertial odometry package with loop closure module and graph optimization github.com/yanliang-wang/FAST_LIO_LC \u2714\ufe0f LidarIMUGPS [Optional] ROS 1 ROS MelodicPCL &gt;= 1.8Eigen &gt;= 3.3.4GTSAM &gt;= 4.0.0 FAST_LIO_SLAM FAST_LIO_SLAM is the integration of FAST_LIO and SC-PGO which is scan context based loop detection and GTSAM based pose-graph optimization github.com/gisbi-kim/FAST_LIO_SLAM \u2714\ufe0f LidarIMUGPS [Optional] ROS 1 PCL &gt;= 1.8Eigen &gt;= 3.3.4 FD-SLAM FD_SLAM is Feature&amp;Distribution-based 3D LiDAR SLAM method based on Surface Representation Refinement.

The default value is   <code>/sensing/lidar/top/outlier_filtered/pointcloud</code> which   is output of the pointcloud pre-processing pipeline from sensing.   You can change this value according to your LiDAR topic name,   or you can choose to use concatenated point cloud:</p> <pre><code>- &lt;arg name=\"input_pointcloud\" default=\"/sensing/lidar/top/outlier_filtered/pointcloud\" description=\"The topic will be used in the localization util module\"/&gt;\n+ &lt;arg name=\"input_pointcloud\" default=\"/sensing/lidar/concatenated/pointcloud\"/&gt;\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> <p>You can add every necessary argument to <code>tier4_localization_component.launch.xml</code> launch file like these examples.

For example, when we plot <code>minor-faults</code> on the horizontal axis and turnaround time on the vertical axis, we can see the following dominant proportional relationship.</p> <p></p> <p>To achieve zero soft page faults, heap allocations must only be made from areas that have been first touched in advance.

A callback that takes sensor data message types as input and output should be written in an in-place algorithm as much as possible. This means that in the following pseudocode, when generating <code>output_msg</code> from <code>input_msg</code>, it is crucial to avoid using buffers as much as possible to reduce the number of memory copies.</p> <pre><code>void callback(const PointCloudMsg &amp;input_msg) {\n  auto output_msg = allocate_msg&lt;PointCloudMsg&gt;(output_size);\n  fill(input_msg, output_msg);\n  publish(std::move(output_msg));\n}\n</code></pre> <p>To improve cache efficiency, implement an in-place style as much as possible, instead of touching memory areas sporadically.

This is a wasteful copying process and should be avoided. We should eliminate unnecessary type conversions by removing dependencies on PCL (e.g., https://github.com/tier4/velodyne_vls/pull/39).

However, the policies used to define them are basically reused even when the configuration changes. Each of temporal performance metrics is categorized into two types: execution frequency and response time. Although there are many types of metrics, such as communication latency, the only two types are considered for simplicity. Execution frequency is observed using rate of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) messages. You will find an enormous number of messages in Autoware, but you don't have to take care of all. Some messages might be critical to functionality and they should be chosen for evaluation. Response time is duration elapsed through a series of processing. A series of processing is referred to as a path. Response time is calculated from timestamps of start and end of a path. Although many paths can be defined in Autoware, you have to choose significant paths.</p> <p>As a hint, here are some characteristics of message and path in order to choose metrics.</p> <ol> <li>Messages and paths on boundaries where observed values from sensors are consumed</li> <li>Messages and paths on boundaries of functions, e.g., a boundary of perception and planning</li> <li>Messages and paths on boundaries where timer-based frequency is switched</li> <li>Messages and paths on boundaries where two different messages are synchronized and merged</li> <li>Messages that must be transmitted at expected frequency, e.g., vehicle command messages</li> </ol> <p>Those hints would be helpful for most configurations but there may be exclusions. Defining metrics precisely requires an understanding of configuration.</p> <p>In addition, it is recommended that metrics be determined incrementally from the architectural level to the detailed design and implementation level. Mixing metrics at different levels of granularity can be confusing.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/others/defining-temporal-performance-metrics/#list-of-sample-metrics","title":"List of sample metrics","text":"<p>This section demonstrates how to define metrics according to the policies explained and has lists of the metrics for Autoware launched according to the tutorial.

Such mapping is usually calibrated automatically using the <code>accel_brake_map_calibrator</code> module, but it may produce a low initial throttle which leads to high start delays.</p> <p>In order to increase the initial throttle, there are two options: increase the initial acceleration output by Autoware, or modify the acceleration to throttle mapping.</p> <p>The initial acceleration output by Autoware can be tuned in the <code>motion_velocity_smoother</code> with parameters <code>engage_velocity</code> and <code>engage_acceleration</code>. However, the <code>vehicle_cmd_gate</code> applies a filter on the control command to prevent too sudden changes in jerk and acceleration, limiting the maximum allowed acceleration while the ego vehicle is stopped.</p> <p>Alternatively, the mapping of acceleration can be tuned to increase the throttle corresponding to the initial acceleration. If we look at an example acceleration map, it does the following conversion: when the ego velocity is <code>0</code> (first column), acceleration values between <code>0.631</code> (first row) and <code>0.836</code> (second row) are converted to a throttle between <code>0%</code> and <code>10%</code>. This means that any initial acceleration bellow <code>0.631m/s\u00b2</code> will not produce any throttle.
